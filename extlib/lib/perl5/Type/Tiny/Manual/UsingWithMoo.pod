=head1 NAME

Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMoo - how to use Type::Tiny and Type::Library with Moo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   {
      package Person;
      
      use Moo;
      use Types::Standard qw( Str Int );
      use Type::Utils qw( declare as where inline_as coerce from );
      
      has name => (
         is      => "ro",
         isa     => Str,
      );
      
      my $PositiveInt = declare
         as        Int,
         where     {  $_ > 0  },
         inline_as { "$_ =~ /^[0-9]+\$/ and $_ > 0" };
      
      coerce $PositiveInt, from Int, q{ abs $_ };
      
      has age => (
         is      => "rwp",
         isa     => $PositiveInt,
         coerce  => $PositiveInt->coercion,
      );
      
      sub get_older {
         my $self = shift;
         my ($years) = @_;
         $PositiveInt->assert_valid($years);
         $self->_set_age($self->age + $years);
      }
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Type::Tiny is tested with L<Moo> 1.001000 and above.

Type::Tiny overloads C<< &{} >>. Moo supports using objects that overload
C<< &{} >> as C<isa> constraints, so Type::Tiny objects can directly be used
in C<isa>.

Moo doesn't support C<< coerce => 1 >> but requires a coderef as a coercion.
However, again it supports using objects that overload C<< &{} >>, which
Type::Coercion does, allowing C<< coerce => $Type->coercion >> to work.

Type::Tiny hooks into Moo's HandleMoose interface to ensure that type
constraints get inflated to Moose type constraints if and when Moo inflates
your class to a full Moose class.

=head2 Optimization

The usual advice for optimizing type constraints applies: use type constraints
which can be inlined whenever possible, and define coercions as strings rather
than coderefs.

Upgrading to Moo 1.002000 or above should provide a slight increase in speed
for type constraints, as it allows them to be inlined into accessors and
constructors.

If creating your own type constraints using C<< Type::Tiny->new >>, then
consider using L<Sub::Quote> to quote the coderef; this allows you to take
advantage of inlining without having to write your own inlining routines.

See also L<Type::Tiny::Manual::Optimization>.
